## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Application failed to start"
**Check**:
1. Logs: `cf logs <app> --recent`
2. Environment: `cf env <app>`
3. Services: `cf services`

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Check**:
1. HDI container deployed
2. Service binding correct
3. Database service running

## Deployment Commands

### Cloud Foundry
```bash
# Login
cf login -a <api-endpoint>

# Build MTA
mbt build -t ./mta_archives

# Deploy
cf deploy mta_archives/my-app_1.0.0.mtar

# Check status
cf apps

# Deploy database
cds deploy --to sqlite:db/data.db

# Start server
cds watch
