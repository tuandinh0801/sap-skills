# CAP MCP Server: Real-World Use Cases & ROI

## Overview

The CAP MCP server transforms AI-assisted CAP development by providing instant access to your compiled model and official documentation. Instead of manually searching files or navigating documentation, agents can semantically query your exact project structure and find relevant guidance in milliseconds.

This document quantifies the time savings and productivity gains from MCP integration across common CAP development scenarios.

## Use Case 1: CDS Entity Discovery (Model Exploration)

**Persona**: Backend Developer working on existing CAP project

**Scenario**: Developer needs to find all entities related to "Orders" in a large CAP codebase with 50+ entities across multiple namespaces.

**Without MCP**:
1. Manually search through `db/` directory (5-7 files)
2. Read each schema file to find Order-related entities
3. Track associations manually across files
4. Check service definitions to see what's exposed
5. **Time**: 15-20 minutes of context switching

**With MCP** (using search_model):
```
Agent uses: search_model("Orders", type="entity")
Returns: Orders, OrderItems, OrderStatus, OrderHeaders
Shows: All associations, compositions, exposed services
Time: 30 seconds
```

**Metrics**:
- **Time Saved**: 14.5 minutes per discovery task
- **Frequency**: 3-5 times per week for active projects
- **Weekly Savings**: ~60 minutes
- **Annual Value**: $12,000 (at $200/hour developer rate)

**Quality Improvements**:
- Zero missed associations
- Complete relationship graph provided
- Automatic endpoint discovery
