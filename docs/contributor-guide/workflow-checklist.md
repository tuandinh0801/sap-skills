- [ ] Last verified date current (<90 days): `last_verified: "2025-12-28"`
- [ ] All package.json dependencies use latest stable versions

**Version Sources**:
- [ ] Verified against official SAP release notes
- [ ] Checked npm registry for latest versions
- [ ] Tested with documented versions

**See**: [quality-assurance.md](quality-assurance.md) for detailed phase descriptions

## Automation & Manifest Generation {#automation}

**After Skill Creation**:
- [ ] Run: `./scripts/sync-plugins.sh`
- [ ] Verify plugin.json generated correctly
- [ ] Check marketplace.json updated with new skill
- [ ] Validate cross-references appear

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check plugin.json exists
ls plugins/<skill-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

# Check marketplace.json includes skill
jq '.plugins | map(.name)' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | grep <skill-name>
```

---

## Git Commit Checklist {#git-commit}

**Files to Include**:
- [ ] plugins/<skill-name>/ (all skill files)
- [ ] .claude-plugin/marketplace.json (updated registry)

**Commit Message Template**:
```
Add <skill-name> for [SAP technology]

- Provides [key features]
- SAP SDK version: <version>
- Tested with: [production evidence]
- Related skills: [cross-references]

Production tested: [evidence]
```
