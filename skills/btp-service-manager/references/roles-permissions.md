## Token Scope Verification

**Check token scopes**:
```bash
# Decode JWT token (without verification)
echo "<access_token>" | cut -d'.' -f2 | base64 -d | jq '.scope'
```

**Expected format**:
```json
{
  "scope": [
    "<xsappname>.subaccount_service_instance_manage",
    "<xsappname>.subaccount_service_instance_read",
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use audit plan for read-only needs
2. **Container Isolation**: Use container plan for application self-service
3. **Separate Credentials**: Different credentials for different environments
4. **Rotate Credentials**: Regular rotation of client secrets
5. **Audit Access**: Monitor who has admin access
6. **X.509 for Production**: Use certificate auth in production
