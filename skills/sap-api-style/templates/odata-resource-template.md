# OData Resource Template

## How to Use This Template

**Purpose**: Document individual OData resources (entity sets) within a service with all available operations.

**When to Use**:
- Creating detailed documentation for a specific OData entity set/resource
- Documenting all CRUD operations on a resource
- Listing navigation properties and custom functions/actions
- Linking from Service Overview to specific resource documentation

**Instructions**:
1. Replace all [bracketed text] with your actual resource information
2. Verify all operations against service metadata
3. Document navigation properties with cardinality (1:1, 1:N)
4. Include permission requirements for each operation type
5. List custom functions and actions with brief descriptions
6. Remove optional sections if not applicable

**Cross-Reference**: Use with [OData Service Overview Template](#odata-service-overview-template) for service context and [OData Operation Template](#odata-operation-template) for detailed operation docs.

**Template Structure**:
- Title & Introduction
- Resource Information (path, key, permissions)
- Operations (CRUD, navigation, custom)
- Common Headers
- Status and Error Codes
- Examples

```
GET /Employees?$expand=Department($select=DepartmentID,Name) HTTP/1.1

Returns employee(s) with only specific Department properties included.
```
