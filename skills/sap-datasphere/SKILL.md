## Data Builder

### Graphical Views

Create views visually by dragging sources and adding transformations.

**Best Practices**:
- Use input parameters for dynamic filtering
- Apply data access controls for row-level security
- Enable persistence for frequently accessed views
- Use lineage analysis to understand dependencies

For detailed graphical view operations, see `references/graphical-sql-views.md`.

### SQL Views

Create views using SQL or SQLScript.

```sql
-- Basic SQL View
SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,

FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name
```

- **Variable**: Runtime parameters

**Creating an Analytic Model**:
1. Add a fact source (view or table)
2. Add dimension associations
3. Define measures with aggregation
4. Configure variables for filtering
5. Set data access controls

For detailed modeling guidance, see `references/data-modeling.md`.

### Dimensions

Categorize and filter analytical data.

**Types**:
