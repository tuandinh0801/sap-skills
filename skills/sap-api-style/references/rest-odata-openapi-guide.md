## OVERVIEW OF REST AND OData APIs

### What Are REST APIs?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for building web services that enables:
- Cross-platform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations over HTTP
- Stateless client-server communication
- Resource-oriented design using URIs
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

**Key Characteristics**:
- Resources represented as URIs (e.g., `/users`, `/orders/{orderID}`)
- Stateless interactions
- HTTP methods define operations
- JSON or XML as primary data formats
- Standard HTTP status codes for responses

### What Are OData APIs?

**OData (Open Data Protocol)** is a RESTful web protocol for querying and updating data with:
- Standardized query syntax for filtering, sorting, and paging
- Consistent metadata structure
- Support for complex operations
- Strong typing and validation
- Three major versions: v2.0, v3.0, v4.01

**Key Characteristics**:
- Metadata-driven architecture
- Query language for complex data operations
- CRUD operations over HTTP
- Standard status codes and error handling
- EDM (Entity Data Model) for type definitions

### Documentation Approaches

| Aspect | REST | OData |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Specification Standard** | OpenAPI 3.0.3 (Swagger) | OData Specification (OASIS) |
| **Data Format** | JSON, XML | JSON, XML |
| **Query Language** | Custom parameters | OData Query Language |
| **Metadata** | OpenAPI Schema | OData EDM |
| **Versioning** | Via URL path or header | Via URL path or OData version |
| **Primary Use** | General-purpose APIs | Data-centric APIs |

### Documentation Standards Source

---

## GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR DESCRIPTIONS

### Core Principles

#### 1. Clarity and Conciseness

**Principle**: Descriptions must be clear, precise, and free of jargon.

- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid technical acronyms unless necessary
- Define unfamiliar terms
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Keep sentences relatively short

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "The ephemeral context datum manifests transient materialization paradigms"
- ✅ "Temporary data that doesn't persist after the request"

#### 2. Correct Spelling and Grammar

**Requirements**:
- Use American English spelling (e.g., "color", not "colour")
- Check for grammar errors
- Maintain consistent terminology across API
- Spell out acronyms on first use: "REST (Representational State Transfer)"

**Tools**:
- Spell checkers
- Grammar checkers (Grammarly, built-in IDE tools)
- Consistency checkers

#### 3. Formatting Standards

**Capitalization**:
- Start sentences with capital letters
- End sentences with periods
- Proper nouns always capitalized
- "API", "HTTP", "REST", "OData" in all caps

**Formatting Examples**:
- ✅ "Retrieves the user profile. Maximum request timeout is 30 seconds."
- ❌ "retrieves the user profile. maximum request timeout is 30 seconds."

#### 4. Imperative vs. Descriptive Language

**Imperative Form** (for operations):
- Start with action verb in third-person singular
- Examples: "Creates a new order", "Retrieves employee data", "Updates the configuration"
- Avoid: "This operation creates..." or "The API creates..."

**Descriptive Form** (for data types, properties):
- Use noun phrases
- Examples: "The unique order identifier", "User email address", "Product inventory count"

### Description Length Guidelines

| Element | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| API Title | 50-80 chars | 80 | Should fit single line in most contexts |
| x-sap-shortText | 100-180 chars | 180 | High-level overview for catalog |
| Operation Summary | 50-150 chars | 255 | Appears in quick reference |
| Operation Description | 100-300 chars | No limit | Additional context beyond summary |
| Parameter Description | 30-100 chars | No limit | Concise explanation of purpose |
| Response Description | 50-150 chars | No limit | Context-specific outcome description |
| Component Description | 50-200 chars | No limit | Data structure explanation |

### Common Description Patterns

#### For Operations (HTTP Endpoints)

**Pattern 1: Simple CRUD Operation**
```
Summary: "Retrieves a single user by ID"
Description: "Fetches complete user profile information including contact details, preferences, and account status."
```

**Pattern 2: Complex Operation**
```
Summary: "Searches for orders with advanced filtering"
Description: "Executes a search query returning orders matching specified criteria. Supports filtering by date range, status, customer, and amount. Results paginated with configurable page size."
```

**Pattern 3: Action/Function**
```
Summary: "Approves a pending document"
Description: "Changes document status from pending to approved and notifies relevant stakeholders. Requires manager-level permissions."
```

#### For Parameters

**Pattern 1: Simple Parameter**
```
"userId": "The unique identifier of the user"
```

**Pattern 2: Parameter with Constraints**
```
"pageSize": "Maximum number of results per page (minimum: 1, maximum: 100, default: 20)"
```

**Pattern 3: Optional Parameter**
```
"includeDetails": "If true, includes detailed breakdown; if false, returns summary only (optional, defaults to false)"
```

#### For Responses

**Pattern 1: Success Response**
```
"200 OK": "Order successfully created. Returns the new order with assigned ID and creation timestamp."
```

**Pattern 2: Error Response - Generic**
```
"400 Bad Request": "Invalid request format or missing required fields. Check error details for specific violations."
```

**Pattern 3: Error Response - Context-Specific**
```
"409 Conflict": "Cannot process order because inventory for product is insufficient. Current stock: 5 units, requested: 10 units."
```

### Documentation Quality Guidelines

#### ✅ Good Parameter Descriptions

```
"The unique employee identifier"
"Filter by status (Open, In Progress, Closed)"
"Number of results per page (1-100, default 20)"
"Search query string (minimum 2 characters)"
"Include subordinate employee records (optional, defaults to false)"
```

#### ❌ Poor Parameter Descriptions

```
"ID"                                    # Too vague
"The status"                           # Obvious, doesn't add value
"This parameter filters results"       # Doesn't explain what it filters
"Required to be provided"              # Type already indicates required
"See documentation"                    # No helpful information
```

### Parameter Organization

**Recommended Order in Documentation**:
1. Path parameters (required)
2. Query parameters (often optional filters)
3. Header parameters
4. Cookie parameters
5. Body parameters (request payload)

**Within Each Category**:
- Required parameters first
- Optional parameters after
- Alphabetical by name within sub-category

## RESPONSES DOCUMENTATION

### Response Overview

**Responses** describe what the API returns for different scenarios:
- Success codes (2xx)
- Client errors (4xx)
- Server errors (5xx)

Each response includes status code and description of outcome.

### Response Structure

#### 1. HTTP Status Code

**Purpose**: Indicates success or type of failure

**Common Status Codes for REST APIs**:

| Code | Status | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **2xx** | **Success** | Request processed successfully |
| 200 | OK | GET, PATCH success; data returned |
| 201 | Created | POST successful; new resource created |
| 202 | Accepted | Async operation queued for processing |
| 204 | No Content | DELETE, POST success; no body |
| **3xx** | **Redirection** | Client action needed for completion |
| 301 | Moved Permanently | Resource permanently moved |
| 304 | Not Modified | Data unchanged since last request |
| **4xx** | **Client Error** | Invalid request or missing data |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid format or missing required field |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required or invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden | Authenticated but insufficient permission |
| 404 | Not Found | Requested resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Request conflicts with current state |
| **5xx** | **Server Error** | Server processing failed |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily unavailable |

#### 2. Response Description

**Field**: `description`

**Requirements**:
- Required for every response code
- Explains outcome in plain language
- Context-specific, not generic
- Describes returned data (if applicable)
- Mentions implications of status

**Guidelines**:
- Begins with capital letter
- **Avoid generic descriptions**: "No content", "Not found"
- **Use specific descriptions**: "Product out of stock", "Employee record not found"
- Mentions returned format (JSON, empty body)
- Explains business context

#### 3. Response Body

**Field**: `content`

**Includes**:
- Media type (application/json, application/xml)
- Schema definition
- Example response data

"Invalid request format. Email field must be in user@example.com format."
"Insufficient permissions. Only managers can approve documents. Contact HR for role assignment."
"Order cannot be modified because it's already been shipped. Contact customer service for options."
```

#### ❌ Poor Response Descriptions

```
"OK"                                              # Too generic
"No content"                                      # Doesn't explain context
"Bad request"                                     # Doesn't explain what's bad
"Not found"                                       # Doesn't explain what wasn't found
"Error"                                           # No helpful information
"See error details"                               # Doesn't describe status code
```

### Response Error Handling

#### Standard Error Response Schema

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Error:
      type: object
      required:
        - errorCode
        - message
      properties:
        errorCode:
          type: string
          description: "Machine-readable error code for programmatic handling"
          example: "INVALID_INPUT"
        message:
          type: string
          description: "Human-readable error message"
          example: "Email field is required and must be valid"
        details:
          type: array
          description: "Detailed information about each error"
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              field:
                type: string
                description: "Field that caused the error"
              issue:
                type: string
                description: "Specific problem with the field"
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: "When error occurred"
```

#### Error Response Documentation Template

```yaml
responses:
  '400':
    description: "[Brief status]. [Explanation of what went wrong]. [How to fix]"
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Error"
        example:
          errorCode: "[SPECIFIC_CODE]"
          message: "[Context-specific message]"
          details: [...]
```

## COMPONENTS AND DEFINITIONS

### What Are Components?

**Components** (in OpenAPI 3.0) define reusable data structures:
- Request/response body schemas
- Parameter definitions
- Response headers
- Security schemes
- Examples

Also called **Definitions** in OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger).

### Schema Documentation

#### Schema Object Structure

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Employee:
      type: object
      required:
        - employeeId
        - firstName
        - lastName
      properties:
        employeeId:
          type: string
          description: "Unique employee identifier assigned by system"
          example: "E12345"

        firstName:
          type: string
          description: "Employee's first name"
          minLength: 1

          example: "Engineering"

        salary:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: "Annual salary in USD (minimum $20,000)"
          minimum: 20000
          example: 85000.00

- Explain primary purpose
- Mention key characteristics

**For Properties (Fields)**:
- Concise description of property meaning
- Explain constraints (min/max, format, allowed values)
- Provide example value
- Mention relationships to other fields

**Naming Conventions**:

| Schema Type | Naming | Examples |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Request Body** | Use operation-specific name | `CreateEmployeeRequest`, `UpdateEmployeeRequest` |
| **Response Body** | Use resource name | `Employee`, `Order`, `Document` |
| **Collection** | Plural form | `Employees`, `Orders`, `Documents` |
| **Error** | Error-specific name | `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError` |

## SECURITY SCHEMES

### What Are Security Schemes?

**Security Schemes** define how APIs authenticate requests:
- Bearer tokens (OAuth 2.0)
- API keys
- Basic authentication
- OpenID Connect

### Common SAP API Security Schemes

#### 1. OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token

**Use Case**: Cloud applications, third-party integrations

**Flow Type**: Client Credentials, Authorization Code, etc.

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OAuth2ClientCredentials:
      type: oauth2
      description: "OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication"
      flows:
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: "https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token"
          refreshUrl: "https://auth.sap.com/oauth/refresh"
          scopes:
            "employees:read": "Read employee data"
            "employees:write": "Create/modify employee data"
            "employees:delete": "Delete employee records"
```

#### 2. API Key Authentication

**Use Case**: Simple API access, testing

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
      description: "API key authentication for direct API access. Obtain key from SAP API Business Hub"
```

#### 3. Basic Authentication

**Use Case**: Legacy systems, simple auth

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      description: "HTTP Basic authentication using username:password encoded in Authorization header"
```

#### 4. OpenID Connect

**Use Case**: Enterprise single sign-on

**Documentation**:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OpenIDConnect:
      type: openIdConnect
      openIdConnectUrl: "https://auth.sap.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
      description: "OpenID Connect authentication for enterprise environments"
```

### Security Scheme Application

#### Apply to All Operations

```yaml
security:
  - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
      - "employees:read"
      - "employees:write"
```

#### Apply to Specific Operations

```yaml
paths:
  /employees:
    get:
      security:
        - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
            - "employees:read"
      # ...

    post:
      security:
        - OAuth2ClientCredentials:
            - "employees:write"
      # ...
```

### Security Documentation Best Practices

#### ✅ Good Security Documentation

```
"OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication.
Obtain access token from https://auth.sap.com/oauth/token using your client credentials.
Include token in Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

#### ❌ Poor Security Documentation

```
"OAuth 2.0"                          # Too vague
"Use authentication"                 # No details
"See SAP documentation"              # No specifics
```

## TAGS

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are labels that group related operations for organization in documentation:
- Organize operations by resource type
- Create documentation structure
- Improve API navigation

### Tag Definition and Usage

#### Tag Object Structure

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Employees"
    description: "Operations for managing employee records including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions"
    externalDocs:
      description: "Employee Management Guide"
      url: "https://help.sap.com/employees"

  - name: "Departments"
    description: "Operations for querying and managing department structures and assignments"
    externalDocs:
      description: "Organization Guide"
      url: "https://help.sap.com/departments"

  - name: "Compensation"
    description: "Operations for managing salary, benefits, and compensation-related data"
```

#### Applying Tags to Operations

```yaml
paths:
  /employees:
    post:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Create a new employee"
      # ...

  /employees/{employeeId}:
    get:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Retrieve employee details"
      # ...

    patch:
      tags:
        - "Employees"
      summary: "Update employee information"
      # ...

  /employees/{employeeId}/compensation:
    get:
      tags:
        - "Compensation"
      summary: "Get employee compensation details"
      # ...
```

### Tag Documentation Guidelines

#### Tag Name

**Requirements**:
- Clear, noun-based names (not verbs)
- Follows resource/domain structure
- Singular or plural consistently
- Capitalized properly

**Examples**:

```
✓ "Employees", "Orders", "Travel Requests", "Expenses"
✗ "Create Employee", "Get Orders", "employee management"
```

#### Tag Description

**Requirements**:
- 1-2 sentences explaining tag's scope
- Explains what operations it contains
- Lists related operations or domains
- Provides context for developers

**Examples**:

```

### Tag Organization Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Resource-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Employees"
  - name: "Departments"
  - name: "Compensation"
  - name: "Benefits"
```

#### Pattern 2: Domain-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Human Resources"
  - name: "Procurement"
  - name: "Finance"
  - name: "Supply Chain"
```

#### Pattern 3: Operation-Based Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - name: "Read Operations"
  - name: "Write Operations"
  - name: "Administrative Operations"
```

## EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION

### What Is External Documentation?

**External Documentation** links from API specification to:
- General guides and tutorials
- Use case documentation
- API governance policies
- Related documentation resources

### Two Levels of External Documentation

#### 1. Top-Level External Documentation

**Scope**: Entire API

**Location**: OpenAPI root level

```yaml
externalDocs:
  description: "Complete API documentation and guides"
  url: "https://help.sap.com/employee-central"
```

#### 2. Operation-Level External Documentation

**Scope**: Individual operations

**Location**: Per-operation specification

```yaml
paths:
  /employees:
    post:
      externalDocs:
        description: "Step-by-step guide to onboarding new employees"
        url: "https://help.sap.com/guides/employee-onboarding"
```

### External Documentation Best Practices

#### ✅ Effective Links

```

#### ❌ Poor Links

```
Description: "Documentation"                          # Too vague
URL: "https://help.sap.com"                          # Root-level, not specific

Description: "Click here"                             # Not descriptive
URL: "https://help.sap.com/some-page"               # No context

Description: "Employee API"                           # Obvious
URL: "https://help.sap.com/different-product"       # Wrong product
```

## BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY

### Documentation Quality Principles

#### 1. Clarity First

- Write descriptions for developers without API context
- Use simple, direct language
- Define technical terms
- Provide practical examples

#### 2. Completeness

- Document every operation, parameter, and response
- Include all status codes (success and error)
- Explain what data is returned
- Describe error scenarios

#### 3. Consistency

- Use consistent terminology across API
- Follow naming conventions strictly
- Maintain uniform description style
- Organize information predictably

#### 4. Context-Specificity

- Avoid generic error descriptions
- Explain business context
- Describe constraints and limitations
- Mention prerequisites or requirements

#### 5. Usability

- Organize information logically
- Group related operations with tags
- Cross-reference related endpoints
- Provide practical examples

### Writing Quality Checklist

Before publishing API documentation, verify:

- [ ] Every operation has meaningful summary (max 255 chars)
- [ ] Operation descriptions provide supplementary context
- [ ] All parameters documented with clear descriptions

## CHARACTER LIMIT REFERENCE TABLE

### Quick Reference: Character Limits for All API Elements

| Element | Max Chars | Notes | Example |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **API Title** | 80 | OpenAPI info.title | "Employee Central" (17 chars) |
| **x-sap-shortText** | 180 | SAP-specific high-level description | "Create, update, and query..." (82 chars) |
| **Operation Summary** | 255 | Appears in operation list | "Retrieve employee by ID" (23 chars) |
| **Package Title** | No strict limit | Catalog display | "SAP SuccessFactors..." |
| **Package Short Desc** | 250 | Not counting spaces | Typical 60-120 chars |
| **Parameter Name** | Language dependent | Matches spec | "employeeId" |
| **Parameter Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-100 | "Employee unique identifier" |
| **Property Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-80 | "User email address" |
| **Error Description** | No strict limit | Recommended 50-150 | "Cannot process order..." |
| **Enum Value Desc** | No strict limit | Recommended 30-80 | "Active employment status" |

### Practical Counting Examples

**For Package Short Description (max 250 chars, not counting spaces)**:

```
Original: "Create, update, and query employee records including personal
           information, organizational assignments, and compensation data"

Count (no spaces): Create,update,andqueryemployeerecordsincludingpersonal...
Character count: 119 ✓ (GOOD - well under 250)
```

**For x-sap-shortText (max 180 chars)**:

```
Original: "Query and manage employee master data, assignments, and
           compensation information with real-time synchronization"

Count: 118 characters ✓ (GOOD - under 180 limit)
```

**For Operation Summary (max 255 chars)**:

```
Original: "Searches for matching orders with advanced filtering by date,
           status, and amount with results pagination"

Count: 118 characters ✓ (GOOD - under 255 limit)
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Naming Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Including Technical Specifics

```
"SAP Employee Central REST API v2.0"
```

**Problem**: Technical specifications shouldn't be in name
**Fix**: "Employee Central"

#### ❌ Using API Type in Name

```
"Purchase Order OData Service"
```

**Problem**: API type is implicit
**Fix**: "Purchase Orders"

#### ❌ Starting with SAP Prefix

```
"SAP Human Resources Employee Management"
```

**Problem**: Redundant context
**Fix**: "Employee Management" (in HR context)

#### ❌ Using Verbs Instead of Nouns

```
"Managing Employee Data"
```

**Problem**: Not a clear entity name
**Fix**: "Employee Data" or "Employee Management"

---

### Description Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Second-Person Language

```
❌ "You can create a new employee"
✅ "Creates a new employee"

❌ "You need to provide the employee ID"
✅ "Requires employee ID in path parameter"
```

#### ❌ Repeating Summary Information

```
Operation Summary: "Creates a new order"

❌ Description: "This operation creates a new order in the system"
✅ Description: "Automatically assigns order number and sends confirmation to customer"
```

#### ❌ Generic Error Descriptions

```
❌ "Bad Request"
❌ "Not Found"
❌ "Server Error"

✅ "Email field must be in user@example.com format"
✅ "No employee found with ID E99999"
✅ "Database temporarily unavailable. Try again in 60 seconds"
```

#### ❌ Including Implementation Details

```
❌ "Calls internal service to validate employee"
✅ "Validates employee against company records"

❌ "Queries three database tables and joins results"
✅ "Retrieves complete employee profile with all departments"
```

#### ❌ Vague Language

```
❌ "Handles employee information"
✅ "Creates, updates, and deletes employee records"

❌ "Returns data"
✅ "Returns array of employees matching search criteria"

❌ "May fail in some cases"
✅ "Returns 409 Conflict if employee email already exists"
```

---

### Parameter Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Obvious Descriptions

```
❌ "The employeeId"
❌ "The status field"
❌ "Required parameter"

✅ "The unique employee identifier"
✅ "Employment status (Active, Inactive, OnLeave)"
✅ "Employee ID required in URL path"
```

#### ❌ Missing Constraints

```
❌ "Number of results per page"
✅ "Number of results per page (minimum 1, maximum 100, default 20)"

❌ "Search query"
✅ "Search query (minimum 2 characters, case-insensitive)"

❌ "Filter value"
✅ "Filter by status (valid values: Open, Closed, Pending)"
```

#### ❌ Inconsistent Formatting

```
❌ Parameter 1: "The employee identifier"
❌ Parameter 2: "department code"
❌ Parameter 3: "Is Active Status"

✅ Parameter 1: "Employee unique identifier"
✅ Parameter 2: "Department code"
✅ Parameter 3: "Active employee status (true/false)"
```

---

### Response Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ No Context

```
❌ "OK"
❌ "Created"
❌ "Bad Request"

✅ "Employee successfully created. Location header contains URL to new resource"
✅ "Employee record not found. Verify employee ID is correct"
✅ "Email field must be valid format (user@example.com)"
```

#### ❌ Missing Error Explanation

```
❌ 400 Bad Request: "Bad request"
✅ 400 Bad Request: "Invalid request format. Email must be in user@example.com format"

❌ 404 Not Found: "Not found"
✅ 404 Not Found: "No employee found with ID E99999"

❌ 409 Conflict: "Conflict"
✅ 409 Conflict: "Cannot process because inventory insufficient. Available: 5 units, Requested: 10 units"
```

#### ❌ Inconsistent Response Structure

```
❌ Some 201 responses show created resource
❌ Some 201 responses show empty body

✅ Consistent structure across all creation endpoints
✅ Document what's returned in each case
```

---

### Schema Documentation Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Missing Property Descriptions

```
❌ properties:
    employeeId: {}
    name: {}
    email: {}

✅ properties:
    employeeId:
      description: "System-assigned unique identifier"
    name:
      description: "Employee full name"
    email:
      description: "Corporate email address"
```

#### ❌ Not Explaining Constraints

```
❌ salary:
    type: number

✅ salary:
    type: number
    description: "Annual salary in USD"
    minimum: 20000
    example: 85000.00
```

#### ❌ Unclear Enum Values

```
❌ status:
    enum: ["A", "I", "L"]

✅ status:
    enum: ["Active", "Inactive", "OnLeave"]
    description: "Employee status. Active = currently employed, Inactive = no longer employed, OnLeave = temporary leave"
```

---

### Organization Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Inconsistent Tag Usage

```
❌ Operation 1: tags: ["Employees"]
❌ Operation 2: tags: ["Employee"]
❌ Operation 3: tags: ["Employee Management"]

✅ All operations consistently use: ["Employees"]
```

#### ❌ Missing Related Links

```
❌ No cross-references between related operations
✅ Link GET to POST, PUT, DELETE for same resource

❌ Orphaned operations with no tag
✅ Every operation tagged for organization
```

#### ❌ Poor External Documentation

```
❌ externalDocs:
    description: "Documentation"
    url: "https://help.sap.com"

✅ externalDocs:
    description: "Employee onboarding workflow guide"
    url: "https://help.sap.com/guides/employee-onboarding"
```

---

### Security Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Unclear Security Requirements

```
❌ No security schemes defined

✅ Clear OAuth 2.0 configuration with token URL and scopes

❌ Security scheme documented but not applied to operations

✅ Security applied to all operations and documented
```

#### ❌ Generic Scope Names

```
❌ scopes:
    "api": "API access"
    "read": "Read access"

✅ scopes:
    "employees:read": "Read employee data"
    "employees:write": "Create and modify employee data"
    "employees:delete": "Delete employee records"
```

---

### Example Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ Unrealistic Examples

```
❌ Example with fake/obvious data that doesn't match real API
❌ Example missing required fields
❌ Example with incorrect data types

✅ Real-world example with all required fields
✅ Data types match schema definition
✅ Values realistic and properly formatted
```

#### ❌ Missing Examples

```
❌ No request body example for POST operation
❌ No error response example
❌ No filtering/pagination example

✅ Complete request and response examples
✅ Show both success and error scenarios
✅ Demonstrate complex features
```
